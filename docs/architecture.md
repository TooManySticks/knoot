# Architecture Overview

The project is divided into several core components:

- **Vector Processing:** Manages text embedding and vector refinement.
- **Security:** Handles data encryption, decryption, and advanced security functions.
- **Cache System:** Provides an LRU cache mechanism.
- **BS Meter Integration:** Validates content with advanced techniques.
- **Performance Management:** Monitors and optimizes system performance.
- **Distribution:** Manages worker pools and task distribution.
- **State Management:** Synchronizes and persists global state.
- **Configuration Management:** Loads, validates, and updates configuration settings.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Manages nodes, edges, and advanced graph queries.
- **Visualization:** Renders and interacts with a knowledge graph.
- **External Services:** Integrates with external APIs and services.
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Orchestrates multi-stage pipelines.
- **Communication:** Implements a message bus for inter-component communication.
- **Machine Learning:** Loads, trains, and infers with ML models.
- **Analytics:** Processes data and generates reports.
- **API Gateway:** Routes and manages API calls.

Each component is implemented in its own module within the `src/` directory.
